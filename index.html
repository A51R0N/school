            <h2>All students attend at least one school camp during the year. These are journeys of discovery. Camps bring the curriculum alive through field work and experiential learning and challenge students through activities such as bushwalking, rock climbing, skiing, abseiling, horse riding and canoeing.

                On camp, students learn about themselves and how to take responsibility for their own decisions and choices; they also learn how to live and work with others.</h2>

            <h2>The Kilmore International School is non-denominational, co-educational day and boarding school conveniently located in a safe rural setting in the township of Kilmore north of Melbourne. The school has a family atmosphere where girls and boys from Melbourne, country Victoria and from around the world become part of a close-knit learning community.

                The Kilmore International School has an impressive record of academic success in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. Our inspiring, experienced and highly qualified teachers enjoy an exceptional relationship with their students, most of whom will attend leading universities throughout the world.

                As a boarding school and home to students from around the world, pastoral care lies at its heart. The Heads and Homeroom teachers know their students thoroughly. We provide a rich variety of co-curricular activities to foster experiential learning and leadership.

                An international education equips students to be future-ready and prepares them for university and successful careers. Education at The Kilmore International School is more than academic achievement. Although academic results such as a high ATAR might give you an interview or university offer, to get the job or make a difference you will be someone who can think critically and creatively, speak and write persuasively, adapt to new challenges and collaborate with and influence others.

                These personal and socials skills are embodied in the IB Learner Profile and students cultivate them by participating in goal-focused school activities and projects under the guidance of their caring and experienced teachers.

                The preparation for academic success in Year 12 starts much earlier.

                “The primary school teachers at TKIS make sure every student gets the care and support they need in all subjects in a way they can understand the topics. TKIS provides a positive environment and inclusiveness to all students at the school” says Katie Jones who joined TKIS last year in Year 6.

                Aarushi SODHI, a Middle School student Year 9 student agrees; “TKIS has provided me with many opportunities to progress my knowledge and further develop myself as a person. The comforting environment of the school created by the teachers and other students has given me confidence in myself and allowed me to discover my true academic potential.”</h2>

                        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The Kilmore International School offers boarding from Year 7. Boarders are the “heart and soul” of the school and experience a family atmosphere where girls and boys from Melbourne, country Victoria and from around the world become part of a close-knit international learning community. Houseparents, the Head of Boarding, the Boarding Manager, medical staff and kitchen staff are responsible for the safety and welfare of boarders. Full or weekly boarding is available.

                            All boarding houses have their own common room with kitchen facilities, television and wireless internet. The dining room provides delicious and well-balanced meals. The school also provides ample space and supervised activities for students to grow, learn and play. All students are members of the local 18-hole golf club as well as the community leisure centre with swimming pool and gymnasium accessible for boarders after hours.

                            The academic program is first class and teachers are available after school and in the evenings to provide extra tutorials. Supervised ‘prep’ or homework in the evenings helps to develop study routines and further improve academic results. Frequent communication between the School and the home ensures parents are kept well-informed of their child’s progress. Weekend excursions, camps and a range of competitions in sport, debating and music provide a rich experience to make lifelong friendships and to develop leadership, tolerance, independence and personal growth. Boarding enables students to live, learn and work in a community.</p>

                    <img src="https://www.kilmore.vic.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TKIS_ChloeSmithPhotography_0021-455x682.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
                    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In today's competitive world, with increasing working hours and less classroom time, teachers need edTech tools which help them manage precious class time efficiently. Instead of focusing on teaching, faculty members are often stuck with completing formal duties, for e.g. taking daily student attendance.

                        Manually taking attendance and registering it in files & musters makes the daily attendance a mundane task for the faculty and unnecessarily consumes classroom time.

                        To overcome such inefficient work processes, there are various school software systems available to speed up the attendance process and reduce manual work. An online attendance management system or digital attendance platform is one of them, which is developed to automate the daily attendance in schools. Additionally, it helps to maintain accurate records and generate summarized student attendance reports.Each student is given a smart RFID card having a unique identification number.
                        The RFID can be installed at the entrance of the school, classroom, library or any other important location.
                        Students carrying their smart cards simply have to pass through the reader and the reader scans their unique identification number and hence the attendance is marked automatically.
                        Since the RFID reader is capable of reading several cards at once, the attendance of multiple students is marked simultaneously.
                        The data from the RFID reader is automatically fetched by the integrated school ERP software. Hence, the schools get the access to student attendance details of every class and section at once.
